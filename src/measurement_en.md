### Reduce Measurement Error

- When you take measurements, keep your eyes level and don't look up or down;
- Whenever possible, have someone assist with the measurements;
- Use a flexible ruler when measuring head circumference, shoulder width, eye height, and interocular distance.
- Use a rigid ruler to draw lines on the wall when measuring head height and width.
